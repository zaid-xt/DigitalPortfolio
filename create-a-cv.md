# Create a CV

## ðŸ“„ Evidence

### âœ… 1. In-Class Create a CV Course

As part of the Work Readiness training, we completed a **Create A CV module** that guided us through the process of creating a professional CV. We were taught what content a strong CV should include (e.g., personal details, education, experience, skills, references).

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

**Situation**:  
Before this activity, I had never created a formal CV tailored for the tech industry, and I wasnâ€™t sure what employers expected.

**Task**:  
The task was to learn how to craft a professional CV by understanding the required sections and structure, using the CV module and checklist as guidance.

**Action**:  
I attended the in-class CV development session, studied examples, and used the checklist to build my own CV. I reviewed my draft against the checklist and made sure it met the standards taught in the module.

**Result**:  
I produced a well-structured, professional CV that highlights my education, technical skills, and projects. I now feel confident submitting this CV to potential employers and using it in applications for internships or junior roles.
