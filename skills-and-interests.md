## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

**Situation**:  
I needed to solidify both my front-end and back-end development skills through real-world applications.

**Task**:  
My goal was to complete certified training and then practically apply that knowledge by building functional, well-structured software solutions.

**Action**:  
I completed two LinkedIn Learning courses and developed three repositoriesâ€”each focusing on different languages and areas: front-end (HTML, CSS, JS), back-end with Java, and a scalable TypeScript-based management system.

**Result**:  
These projects reflect my technical versatility and growth
